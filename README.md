Cyber Anomaly Detection using RNN Language model

The work in this project is based on the paper ["Deep Learning for Unsupervised Insider Threat Detection
in Structured Cybersecurity Data Streams"](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1710.00811.pdf) and the implementation is loosly based on the safekit project [code.](https://github.com/pnnl/safekit) 

The paper is referencing this LANL security data ["Comprehensive, Multi-Source Cyber-Security Events"](https://csr.lanl.gov/data/cyber1/) only the proc.txt and redteam.txt are used in the paper.
