## Experiment 2

### This is our own implementation based on the understanding of the paper [Recurrent Neural Network Language Models for Open Vocabulary Event-Level Cyber Anomaly Detection](https://arxiv.org/abs/1712.00557)

### There are two notebooks for different models, regular LSTM and Bidirctional LSTM. The processing for each user data is sequential.

### There are two version of experimental notbooks. _v2 code was reorganized to process all users data in a list. The current version does have memory consumption issue. So we'll leave it as is for now and might expermient with other modes or toolkits, for example Pytorch.

### experiment3 directory include different model of processing user logs which simulate a depolyment environment.
