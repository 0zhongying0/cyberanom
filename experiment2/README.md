## Experiment 2

### This is our own implementation based on the understanding of the paper [Recurrent Neural Network Language Models for Open Vocabulary Event-Level Cyber Anomaly Detection](https://arxiv.org/abs/1712.00557)

### There are two notebooks for different models, regular LSTM and Bidirctional LSTM. The processing for each user data is sequential, the we interpret the results using xxx notebook.
