## Experiment 5

### The model is based on the one in experiment3 but here we attempt to train in a reverse order. Our hypothesis is, if we have enough training days we should be able to model normal behaviour than anomalies. What we found is that most of the users' data we selected have anomalies during earlier days so we are facing two issues, first most of the users' data we selected have anomalies on day 8,12 than later, and second issue is that few have anomalies at day 26 and non after that.

#### our experiment will process data in reverse order from day 30 to day 0
